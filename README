    px

    a minimalistic pixel & sprite editor

    - WORK IN PROGRESS -

RATIONALE

I tried grafx2, mtPaint, pixen, photoshop, etc. The verdict: No Thanks. Put simply,
they're built for novices and their workflow is inefficient, especially for animation.

GOALS

* Everything that can be controlled via the keyboard, is.
* No GUI. In other words: Fuck GTK/Qt, it's OpenGL all the way down.
* Designed with great care and love with pixel artists and animators in mind.
* Optimized for advanced users. No hand-holding. Vi-like philosophy.
* Small, hackable codebase. The aim is < 5KLOC. GLFW is the only dependency.
